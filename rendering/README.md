This is a project based on https://github.com/ebruneton/precomputed_atmospheric_scattering and https://github.com/wangyiyun/Cloud-Generation/tree/master/CloudGeneration, and is the project for the second part of COMP 5411 at HKUST.

# Our code
project/shader/demoFS.glsl contains most of our implementation for cloud rendering from scratch. These parts are commented with "Addtional" note (line 89 ~ line 300) to seperate from parts by Eric Bruneton. 

# How to run
This is a WebGL2 program, while it may require a small web server to have it rendered properly. We used Servez to have it running, refer to https://webglfundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl-setup-and-installation.html if you are not sure. After Browser is launched, click on demo.html to see the rendered page.
